# ANALYZE-DEATH-AGE-DIFFERENCE-OF-RIGHT-HANDERS-WITH-LEFT-HANDERS
                   
The "Analyze Death Age Difference of Right Handers with Left Handers" project 
delves into exploring the potential connection between handedness and age at death. 
The central focus of the project is to investigate the widely circulated notion that left￾handers experience a shorter lifespan compared to right-handers. By utilizing age 
distribution data and Bayesian statistical analysis, the project aims to unveil whether 
this age disparity can be attributed solely to the evolving rates of left-handedness over 
time, thereby challenging the assertion of premature mortality among left-handers.


The project employs the Python programming language, leveraging the pandas 
library for effective data manipulation, and applies Bayesian statistics to provide a 
comprehensive analysis. The core analytical process involves computing the 
probability of an individual being a specific age at the time of their death, contingent 
on their reported handedness—whether left-handed or right-handed. By harnessing 
historical data on age distribution and the prevalence of left-handedness, the project 
endeavors to unearth any potential correlations between handedness and longevity.



Multiple tasks constitute the project, including loading and preprocessing relevant 
data, calculating left-handedness probabilities based on age cohorts, deriving overall 
probabilities of left-handedness and right-handedness, and creating visualizations to 
showcase the age distribution probabilities for both left-handed and right-handed 
individuals. Furthermore, the study delves into assessing the mean age at death for 
each group, shedding light on possible age discrepancies.



Ultimately, the project seeks to provide a nuanced perspective on the alleged link 
between handedness and mortality. Through rigorous analytical methods, including 
Bayesian statistics, the study endeavors to ascertain whether the observed difference 
in age at death can be ascribed to changing left-handedness rates across different time 
periods or whether other contributing factors are at play. By embracing a data-driven 
approach, the project contributes to a deeper comprehension of the intricate interplay
between handedness and mortality, potentially challenging conventional assumptions 
about the lifespan of left-handers.
